    "One of the main intellectual developments which took place within the time period covered by the Papers Past newspaper open data pilot is the development and publication of the theory of evolution by natural selection (1859 onwards). This engendered a lot of public debate, including debate over the consequences of these ideas for religious beliefs and believers. Ballantyne (2012) and Crane (2013) provide clear evidence that this discussion was carried out in New Zealand newspapers. Both the important of the issue and the knowledge that it is present in the dataset make it a good test subject for the corpus."
