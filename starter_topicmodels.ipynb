The words for days of the week, the use of 'visit' etc, suggest that this topic *might* indicate reporting of public events. 14 may also be of interest, but seems to concern council meetings more than does topic 2 (this is partically based off a sense of the number of local council and road board meetings reported in the Oxford Observer, which makes up a large proportion of this starter dataset).\n",

It would be unwise to not have a look at some of the documents high in topic 29."
